Alright what I am trying to do is automate sending a picture to instagram as well as a caption and than sending it to instagram!

so first I import the packages needed by doing "pip install instabot"
  I put this into my mac terminal as well as the vscode terminal
  
#I than create a file that is accessible to me 
mkdir NEW
